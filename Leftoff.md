# OverView
This document is for me to know what I was doing last and not have to reremember what I was doing.

#What I was working on last:
- Working on the checkout process and order system, specifcally need to make sure that I have the order system working properly with the DB layer and the checkout process.
- I was working on implementing the order items table to keep track of what items are in an order.
- All order items need to be linked to the appropriate itemsize (remember this was product and needs to be product size which is connected to the producti variation).

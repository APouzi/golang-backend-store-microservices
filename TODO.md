# MVP Ecommerce Site to Launch

## TODO Backend
*It's important to realize that we are phase 1 and MVP so we are not focusing on features such as membership loyalty, email campaigns, etc.*. We are launching an MVP that will allow us to sell products online, email users of orders, etc.

- [*] Finish all gets for Products, Product variation and Inventory check for the checkout process.
- [*] Implement Stripe Confirmation for payment processing.
- [ ] Add Redis to cache Cart items and cart sessions.? Do we even need to use Redis? Can we use in memory cache? Maybe Phase 2
- [ ] Organize DB layer endpoint into different files to be more organized.
- [*] Clean up the dockerfiles to be two stage builds for better performance, security and size. (Huge improvements! Whooo!!)
- [ ] Make sure search is working properly with database. Figure out if I need to add a full text index, other performance improvements. Phase one, we may just need to do simple searches based on names, maybe tags and what not.
- [ ] Checkout Process:
    - [ ] Get appropriate names for everything, into metadata
    - [ ] Completion of checkout process:
